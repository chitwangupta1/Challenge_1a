üß† PDF Heading Extractor ‚Äì Functional Breakdown
This project is designed to extract meaningful hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3) from a PDF document by combining font analysis, text heuristics, and layout intelligence using tools like PyMuPDF and pdfplumber.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Libraries Used
fitz from PyMuPDF: For reading PDF files and accessing detailed layout information like font size, boldness, etc.

pdfplumber: For detecting and excluding tables from consideration.

re: For applying regex-based text filtering (e.g., removing captions, ignoring page headers).

Counter: To identify most common font sizes for heading detection.

(Optional) spacy: For advanced NLP tasks (e.g., sentence detection, entity recognition ‚Äî if needed).

üîç Main Functions and Their Roles
### extract_font_statistics(doc)
Purpose:
Analyze all text spans in the PDF to collect font sizes and frequency counts to determine the most commonly used sizes.

Approach:

Iterates through each page, each block, and each span to collect font sizes.

Uses Counter to count font size frequencies.

Helps in determining which font sizes likely represent headings versus body text.

python
Copy
Edit
font_counter = Counter()
for page in doc:
    for block in page.get_text("dict")["blocks"]:
        for line in block.get("lines", []):
            for span in line.get("spans", []):
                font_counter[round(span["size"], 1)] += 1
### detect_heading_levels(font_counter)
Purpose:
Assign H1, H2, H3 levels based on the top N font sizes.

Approach:

Sort font sizes by size (not frequency) in descending order.

Map the largest size to H1, second to H2, third to H3.

python
Copy
Edit
top_fonts = sorted(font_counter.keys(), reverse=True)
heading_levels = {top_fonts[0]: "H1", top_fonts[1]: "H2", top_fonts[2]: "H3"}
### get_table_bounding_boxes(pdfplumber_page)
Purpose:
Detect and return bounding boxes of tables to avoid extracting headings inside tables.

Approach:

Use pdfplumber's extract_tables() method.

Each table is stored as a rectangular box (x0, y0, x1, y1).

All text inside these boxes is excluded from heading detection.

### is_invalid_text(text)
Purpose:
Reject spans that are clearly not headings, such as captions, tables, codes, etc.

Heuristics Used:

Reject if starts with "Figure", "Table", "Fig", etc.

Reject short lines (e.g., 1-2 words).

Reject lines in all lowercase or overly numeric.

Reject if contains too much punctuation or looks like metadata.

python
Copy
Edit
if re.match(r'^(Figure|Table|Fig)\b', text): return True
if len(text.split()) <= 2: return True
if text.islower(): return True
### is_inside_table(span_bbox, table_bboxes)
Purpose:
Given a text span and a list of table bounding boxes, determine if the span is within any table.

Approach:

Use bounding box overlap logic.

If span_bbox intersects with any table_bbox, reject it.

python
Copy
Edit
for table_bbox in table_bboxes:
    if intersects(span_bbox, table_bbox):
        return True
### score_heading_candidate(text, span)
Purpose:
Score a candidate text span based on features that indicate it might be a heading.

Heuristic Features:

Text is title-cased or uppercase.

Ends without punctuation.

Is center-aligned.

Span is bold.

Font size is larger than paragraph average.

Returns a score, and only spans above a threshold are retained as headings.

### extract_headings_from_page(page, heading_levels, table_bboxes)
Purpose:
From one page, extract all text spans that:

Are not inside tables.

Are not invalid.

Belong to one of the heading levels (by font size).

Returns:

A list of heading objects:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "level": "H1", "page": 3, "text": "Chapter 1: Introduction" }
### parse_pdf_for_headings(filepath)
Purpose:
The main function that processes the entire PDF.

Steps:

Open with fitz and pdfplumber.

Extract font statistics ‚Üí Detect heading levels.

For each page:

Get table areas.

Use layout info from fitz.

Filter invalid or table-contained spans.

Score candidates.

Save structured headings to JSON.

üì• Output Format
The extracted headings are returned as structured JSON:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "level": "H1",
    "page": 1,
    "text": "1. Introduction to the Foundation Level Extensions"
  },
  {
    "level": "H2",
    "page": 2,
    "text": "1.1 Purpose of the Document"
  }
]
This format is ideal for:

TOC generation

Chunk-based summarization

RAG pipelines with heading context

üß† Heuristics Recap
Feature	Description
Font Size	Larger than average = likely heading
Boldness	Bold = higher chance of heading
Text Length	Not too short or too long
Capitalization	Title-case or ALL CAPS preferred
Table Check	Skip if inside detected table
Punctuation	No end punctuation like ., : etc.
Alignment	Centered or left-aligned
